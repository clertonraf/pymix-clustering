	non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, is clinically heterogeneous: 40\% of patients
	respond well to current therapy and have prolonged survival, whereas
	the remainder succumb to the disease. We proposed that this variability
	in natural history reflects unrecognized molecular heterogeneity
	in the tumours. Using DNA microarrays, we have conducted a systematic
	characterization of gene expression in B-cell malignancies. Here
	we show that there is diversity in gene expression among the tumours
	of DLBCL patients, apparently reflecting the variation in tumour
	proliferation rate, host response and differentiation state of the
	tumour. We identified two molecularly distinct forms of DLBCL which
	had gene expression patterns indicative of different stages of B-cell
	differentiation. One type expressed genes characteristic of germinal
	centre B cells ('germinal centre B-like DLBCL'); the second type
	expressed genes normally induced during in vitro activation of peripheral
	blood B cells ('activated B-like DLBCL'). Patients with germinal
	centre B-like DLBCL had a significantly better overall survival than
	those with activated B-like DLBCL. The molecular classification of
	tumours on the basis of gene expression can thus identify previously
	undetected and clinically significant subtypes of cancer.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE AND EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Clear cell sarcoma of the kidney
	(CCSK), the second most common renal tumor in children, poses significant
	diagnostic challenges. No positive diagnostic markers are available,
	and the pathogenesis of CCSK remains an enigma. To address these
	challenges, the gene expression patterns of 14 CCSKs were compared
	with 15 Wilms tumors and 3 fetal kidney samples using oligonucleotide
	arrays. RESULTS: Using unsupervised methods, the gene expression
	profile of CCSK was distinctive: differentially expressed genes could
	largely be grouped into four categories: (a) a wide variety of neural
	markers, (b) members of the Sonic hedgehog pathway, (c) members of
	the phosphoinositide-3-kinase/Akt cell proliferation pathway, and
	(d) known therapeutic targets. Corresponding changes in critical
	proteins using Western blot and/or immunohistochemistry confirmed
	the up-regulation of these pathways and proteins. In particular,
	CD117 and epidermal growth factor receptor are up-regulated at the
	protein level in many CCSKs, providing potential therapeutic targets.
	One of the neural markers, nerve growth factor receptor, represents
	a promising diagnostic tool for CCSK. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests
	that CCSKs arise within a renal mesenchymal cell that shows a wide
	variety of neural markers. As such, it seems to be susceptible to
	genetic changes also seen in a variety of other neuroectodermal and
	neuronal tumors, including activation of Sonic hedgehog and phosphoinositide-3-kinase/Akt
	pathways. Involvement of these pathways in CCSKs implicates their
	widening role in tumorigenesis.},

	such as the adenomatous polyposis coli and Axin tumor suppressor
	proteins. We used oligonucleotide microarrays to identify genes of
	which expression was activated in OEAs with beta-catenin dysregulation
	compared with OEAs lacking Wnt/beta-catenin pathway defects. Using
	microarray and quantitative PCR-based approaches, we found that fibroblast
	growth factor (FGF9) expression was increased >6-fold in primary
	OEAs with Wnt/beta-catenin pathway defects compared with OEAs lacking
	such defects. Evidence that beta-catenin and TCFs regulate FGF9 expression
	in several epithelial cell lines was obtained. We found FGF9 was
	mitogenic for epithelial cells and fibroblasts and FGF9 could stimulate
	invasion of epithelial and endothelial cells through Matrigel in
	transwell assays. Furthermore, FGF9 could promote neoplastic transformation
	of the E1A-immortalized RK3E epithelial cell line, and short hairpin
	RNA-mediated inhibition of endogenous FGF9 expression in the OEA
	cell line TOV112D, which carries a beta-catenin mutation, inhibited
	neoplastic growth properties of the cells. Our findings support the
	notion that FGF9 is a key factor contributing to the cancer phenotype
	of OEAs carrying Wnt/beta-catenin pathway defects.},

	To further characterize the clinical relevance of tumor subtypes,
	we evaluated as surrogate markers two genes differentially expressed

	staining for MUC1, a gene highly expressed in the subgroups with

	therapeutic decisions and prognostic estimation more than any other
	variable. Among high-grade gliomas, histologically classic glioblastomas
	and anaplastic oligodendrogliomas follow markedly different clinical
	courses. Unfortunately, many malignant gliomas are diagnostically
	challenging; these nonclassic lesions are difficult to classify by
	histological features, generating considerable interobserver variability
	and limited diagnostic reproducibility. The resulting tentative pathological
	diagnoses create significant clinical confusion. We investigated
	whether gene expression profiling, coupled with class prediction
	methodology, could be used to classify high-grade gliomas in a manner
	more objective, explicit, and consistent than standard pathology.
	Microarray analysis was used to determine the expression of approximately
	12000 genes in a set of 50 gliomas, 28 glioblastomas and 22 anaplastic
	oligodendrogliomas. Supervised learning approaches were used to build
	a two-class prediction model based on a subset of 14 glioblastomas
	and 7 anaplastic oligodendrogliomas with classic histology. A 20-feature
	k-nearest neighbor model correctly classified 18 of the 21 classic
	cases in leave-one-out cross-validation when compared with pathological
	diagnoses. This model was then used to predict the classification
	of clinically common, histologically nonclassic samples. When tumors
	were classified according to pathology, the survival of patients
	with nonclassic glioblastoma and nonclassic anaplastic oligodendroglioma
	was not significantly different (P = 0.19). However, class distinctions
	according to the model were significantly associated with survival
	outcome (P = 0.05). This class prediction model was capable of classifying
	high-grade, nonclassic glial tumors objectively and reproducibly.
	Moreover, the model provided a more accurate predictor of prognosis
	in these nonclassic lesions than did pathological classification.
	These data suggest that class prediction models, based on defined

	progression are unclear. Using laser-capture microdissection to isolate
	101 cell populations, we have profiled prostate cancer progression
	from benign epithelium to metastatic disease. By analyzing expression
	signatures in the context of over 14,000 'molecular concepts', or
	sets of biologically connected genes, we generated an integrative
	model of progression. Molecular concepts that demarcate critical
	transitions in progression include protein biosynthesis, E26 transformation-specific
	(ETS) family transcriptional targets, androgen signaling and cell
	proliferation. Of note, relative to low-grade prostate cancer (Gleason
	pattern 3), high-grade cancer (Gleason pattern 4) shows an attenuated
	androgen signaling signature, similar to metastatic prostate cancer,
	which may reflect dedifferentiation and explain the clinical association
	of grade with prognosis. Taken together, these data show that analyzing
	gene expression signatures in the context of a compendium of molecular
	concepts is useful in understanding cancer biology.},

  abstract = {Breast cancer patients with the same stage of disease can have markedly
	different treatment responses and overall outcome. The strongest
	predictors for metastases (for example, lymph node status and histological
	grade) fail to classify accurately breast tumours according to their
	clinical behaviour. Chemotherapy or hormonal therapy reduces the
	risk of distant metastases by approximately one-third; however, 70-80\%
	of patients receiving this treatment would have survived without
	it. None of the signatures of breast cancer gene expression reported
	to date allow for patient-tailored therapy strategies. Here we used
	DNA microarray analysis on primary breast tumours of 117 young patients,
	and applied supervised classification to identify a gene expression
	signature strongly predictive of a short interval to distant metastases
	('poor prognosis' signature) in patients without tumour cells in
	local lymph nodes at diagnosis (lymph node negative). In addition,
	we established a signature that identifies tumours of BRCA1 carriers.
	The poor prognosis signature consists of genes regulating cell cycle,
	invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis. This gene expression profile
	will outperform all currently used clinical parameters in predicting
	disease outcome. Our findings provide a strategy to select patients
	who would benefit from adjuvant therapy.},

  abstract = {Prognostic and predictive factors are indispensable tools in the treatment
	of patients with neoplastic disease. For the most part, such factors
	rely on a few specific cell surface, histological, or gross pathologic
	features. Gene expression assays have the potential to supplement
	what were previously a few distinct features with many thousands
	of features. We have developed Bayesian regression models that provide
	predictive capability based on gene expression data derived from
	DNA microarray analysis of a series of primary breast cancer samples.
	These patterns have the capacity to discriminate breast tumors on
	the basis of estrogen receptor status and also on the categorized
	lymph node status. Importantly, we assess the utility and validity
	of such models in predicting the status of tumors in crossvalidation
	determinations. The practical value of such approaches relies on
	the ability not only to assess relative probabilities of clinical
	outcomes for future samples but also to provide an honest assessment
	of the uncertainties associated with such predictive classifications
	on the basis of the selection of gene subsets for each validation
	analysis. This latter point is of critical importance in the ability
	to apply these methodologies to clinical assessment of tumor phenotype.},

	on the concept of tailoring the intensity of therapy to a patient's

	In addition, another ALL subgroup was identified based on its unique
	expression profile. Examination of the genes comprising the expression
	signatures provided important insights into the biology of these
	leukemia subgroups. Further, within some genetic subgroups, expression
	profiles identified those patients that would eventually fail therapy.
	Thus, the single platform of expression profiling should enhance
	the accurate risk stratification of pediatric ALL patients.},
