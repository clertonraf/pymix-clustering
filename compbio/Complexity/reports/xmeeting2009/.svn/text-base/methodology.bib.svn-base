	a collection of user-friendly web-based interfaces and applications
	are available to help users effectively explore, visualize and download
	the thousands of experiments and tens of millions of gene expression
	patterns stored in GEO. This paper provides a summary of the GEO

	Our method of "nearest shrunken centroids" identifies subsets of
	genes that best characterize each class. The technique is general
	and can be used in many other classification problems. To demonstrate
	its effectiveness, we show that the method was highly efficient in
	finding genes for classifying small round blue cell tumors and leukemias.},
