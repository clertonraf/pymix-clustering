	the appropriate error rate to control in many applied multiple testing
	problems. A simple procedure was given there as an FDR controlling
	procedure for independent test statistics and was shown to be much
	more powerful than comparable procedures which control the traditional
	familywise error rate. We prove that this same procedure also controls
	the false discovery rate when the test statistics have positive regression
	dependency on each of the test statistics corresponding to the true
	null hypotheses. This condition for positive dependency is general
	enough to cover many problems of practical interest, including the
	comparisons of many treatments with a single control, multivariate
	normal test statistics with positive correlation matrix and multivariate
	t. Furthermore, the test statistics may be discrete, and the tested
	hypotheses composite without posing special difficulties. For all
	other forms of dependency, a simple conservative modification of
	the procedure controls the false discovery rate. Thus the range of
	problems for which a procedure with proven FDR control can be offered
	is greatly increased.},

	applies a combination of mathematical and statistical methods to

	Unfortunately, these data tables are often corrupted with extreme

	be both the understanding of large-scale shifts in gene effects and
	the isolation of particular sample-by-gene effects that might be

	"cleaning" or imputation of the data table before analysis. We illustrate

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: This paper introduces the software EMMIX-GENE that has
	been developed for the specific purpose of a model-based approach
	to the clustering of microarray expression data, in particular, of
	tissue samples on a very large number of genes. The latter is a nonstandard
	problem in parametric cluster analysis because the dimension of the
	feature space (the number of genes) is typically much greater than
	the number of tissues. A feasible approach is provided by first selecting
	a subset of the genes relevant for the clustering of the tissue samples
	by fitting mixtures of t distributions to rank the genes in order
	of increasing size of the likelihood ratio statistic for the test
	of one versus two components in the mixture model. The imposition
	of a threshold on the likelihood ratio statistic used in conjunction
	with a threshold on the size of a cluster allows the selection of
	a relevant set of genes. However, even this reduced set of genes
	will usually be too large for a normal mixture model to be fitted
	directly to the tissues, and so the use of mixtures of factor analyzers
	is exploited to reduce effectively the dimension of the feature space
	of genes. RESULTS: The usefulness of the EMMIX-GENE approach for
	the clustering of tissue samples is demonstrated on two well-known
	data sets on colon and leukaemia tissues. For both data sets, relevant
	subsets of the genes are able to be selected that reveal interesting
	clusterings of the tissues that are either consistent with the external
	classification of the tissues or with background and biological knowledge
	of these sets. AVAILABILITY: EMMIX-GENE is available at http://www.maths.uq.edu.au/~gjm/emmix-gene/},

	are seeking to develop a computer system for powerful and reliable
	cancer diagnostic model creation based on microarray data. To keep
	a realistic perspective on clinical applications we focus on multicategory
	diagnosis. To equip the system with the optimum combination of classifier,
	gene selection and cross-validation methods, we performed a systematic
	and comprehensive evaluation of several major algorithms for multicategory
	classification, several gene selection methods, multiple ensemble
	classifier methods and two cross-validation designs using 11 datasets
	spanning 74 diagnostic categories and 41 cancer types and 12 normal
	tissue types. RESULTS: Multicategory support vector machines (MC-SVMs)
	are the most effective classifiers in performing accurate cancer
	diagnosis from gene expression data. The MC-SVM techniques by Crammer
	and Singer, Weston and Watkins and one-versus-rest were found to
	be the best methods in this domain. MC-SVMs outperform other popular
	machine learning algorithms, such as k-nearest neighbors, backpropagation
	and probabilistic neural networks, often to a remarkable degree.
	Gene selection techniques can significantly improve the classification
	performance of both MC-SVMs and other non-SVM learning algorithms.
	Ensemble classifiers do not generally improve performance of the
	best non-ensemble models. These results guided the construction of
	a software system GEMS (Gene Expression Model Selector) that automates
	high-quality model construction and enforces sound optimization and
	performance estimation procedures. This is the first such system
	to be informed by a rigorous comparative analysis of the available

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Clustering is a useful exploratory technique for the analysis
	of gene expression data. Many different heuristic clustering algorithms
	have been proposed in this context. Clustering algorithms based on
	probability models offer a principled alternative to heuristic algorithms.
	In particular, model-based clustering assumes that the data is generated
	by a finite mixture of underlying probability distributions such
	as multivariate normal distributions. The issues of selecting a 'good'
	clustering method and determining the 'correct' number of clusters
	are reduced to model selection problems in the probability framework.
	Gaussian mixture models have been shown to be a powerful tool for
	clustering in many applications. RESULTS: We benchmarked the performance
	of model-based clustering on several synthetic and real gene expression
	data sets for which external evaluation criteria were available.
	The model-based approach has superior performance on our synthetic
	data sets, consistently selecting the correct model and the number
	of clusters. On real expression data, the model-based approach produced
	clusters of quality comparable to a leading heuristic clustering
	algorithm, but with the key advantage of suggesting the number of
	clusters and an appropriate model. We also explored the validity
	of the Gaussian mixture assumption on different transformations of
	real data. We also assessed the degree to which these real gene expression
	data sets fit multivariate Gaussian distributions both before and
	after subjecting them to commonly used data transformations. Suitably
	chosen transformations seem to result in reasonable fits. AVAILABILITY:
