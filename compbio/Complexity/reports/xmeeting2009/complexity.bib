  abstract = {Therapies for patients with cancer have changed gradually over the
	past decade, moving away from the administration of broadly acting
	cytotoxic drugs towards the use of more-specific therapies that are
	targeted to each tumour. To facilitate this shift, tests need to
	be developed to identify those individuals who require therapy and
	those who are most likely to benefit from certain therapies. In particular,
	tests that predict the clinical outcome for patients on the basis
	of the genes expressed by their tumours are likely to increasingly
	affect patient management, heralding a new era of personalized medicine.},

We shrink the prototypes and hence obtain a classifier that is often more accurate than competing methods. Our method of "nearest shrunken centroids" identifies subsets of genes that best characterize each class. The technique is general and can be used in many other classification problems. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we show that the method was highly efficient in finding genes for classifying small round blue cell tumors and leukemias.},
