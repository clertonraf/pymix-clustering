  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Identifying significant genes among thousands of sequences
	on a microarray is a central challenge for cancer research in bioinformatics.
	The ultimate goal is to detect the genes that are involved in disease
	outbreak and progression. A multitude of methods have been proposed
	for this task of feature selection, yet the selected gene lists differ
	greatly between different methods. To accomplish biologically meaningful
	gene selection from microarray data, we have to understand the theoretical
	connections and the differences between these methods. In this article,
	we define a kernel-based framework for feature selection based on
	the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion and backward elimination,
	called BAHSIC. We show that several well-known feature selectors
	are instances of BAHSIC, thereby clarifying their relationship. Furthermore,
	by choosing a different kernel, BAHSIC allows us to easily define
	novel feature selection algorithms. As a further advantage, feature
	selection via BAHSIC works directly on multiclass problems. RESULTS:
	In a broad experimental evaluation, the members of the BAHSIC family
	reach high levels of accuracy and robustness when compared to other
	feature selection techniques. Experiments show that features selected
	with a linear kernel provide the best classification performance
	in general, but if strong non-linearities are present in the data
	then non-linear kernels can be more suitable. AVAILABILITY: Accompanying

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Cancer diagnosis is one of the most important emerging
	clinical applications of gene expression microarray technology. We
	are seeking to develop a computer system for powerful and reliable
	cancer diagnostic model creation based on microarray data. To keep
	a realistic perspective on clinical applications we focus on multicategory
	diagnosis. To equip the system with the optimum combination of classifier,
	gene selection and cross-validation methods, we performed a systematic
	and comprehensive evaluation of several major algorithms for multicategory
	classification, several gene selection methods, multiple ensemble
	classifier methods and two cross-validation designs using 11 datasets
	spanning 74 diagnostic categories and 41 cancer types and 12 normal
	tissue types. RESULTS: Multicategory support vector machines (MC-SVMs)
	are the most effective classifiers in performing accurate cancer
	diagnosis from gene expression data. The MC-SVM techniques by Crammer
	and Singer, Weston and Watkins and one-versus-rest were found to
	be the best methods in this domain. MC-SVMs outperform other popular
	machine learning algorithms, such as k-nearest neighbors, backpropagation
	and probabilistic neural networks, often to a remarkable degree.
	Gene selection techniques can significantly improve the classification
	performance of both MC-SVMs and other non-SVM learning algorithms.
	Ensemble classifiers do not generally improve performance of the
	best non-ensemble models. These results guided the construction of
	a software system GEMS (Gene Expression Model Selector) that automates
	high-quality model construction and enforces sound optimization and
	performance estimation procedures. This is the first such system
	to be informed by a rigorous comparative analysis of the available
	algorithms and datasets. AVAILABILITY: The software system GEMS is
	available for download from http://www.gems-system.org for non-commercial
	use. CONTACT: alexander.statnikov@vanderbilt.edu.},

  abstract = {Microarrays can measure the expression of thousands of genes to identify
	changes in expression between different biological states. Methods
	are needed to determine the significance of these changes while accounting
	for the enormous number of genes. We describe a method, Significance
	Analysis of Microarrays (SAM), that assigns a score to each gene
	on the basis of change in gene expression relative to the standard
	deviation of repeated measurements. For genes with scores greater
	than an adjustable threshold, SAM uses permutations of the repeated
	measurements to estimate the percentage of genes identified by chance,
	the false discovery rate (FDR). When the transcriptional response
	of human cells to ionizing radiation was measured by microarrays,
	SAM identified 34 genes that changed at least 1.5-fold with an estimated
	FDR of 12\%, compared with FDRs of 60 and 84\% by using conventional
	methods of analysis. Of the 34 genes, 19 were involved in cell cycle
	regulation and 3 in apoptosis. Surprisingly, four nucleotide excision
	repair genes were induced, suggesting that this repair pathway for
	UV-damaged DNA might play a previously unrecognized role in repairing
	DNA damaged by ionizing radiation.},
