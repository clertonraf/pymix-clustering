  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Microarray classification typically possesses two striking
	attributes: (1) classifier design and error estimation are based
	on remarkably small samples and (2) cross-validation error estimation
	is employed in the majority of the papers. Thus, it is necessary
	to have a quantifiable understanding of the behavior of cross-validation
	in the context of very small samples. RESULTS: An extensive simulation
	study has been performed comparing cross-validation, resubstitution
	and bootstrap estimation for three popular classification rules-linear
	discriminant analysis, 3-nearest-neighbor and decision trees (CART)-using
	both synthetic and real breast-cancer patient data. Comparison is
	via the distribution of differences between the estimated and true
	errors. Various statistics for the deviation distribution have been
	computed: mean (for estimator bias), variance (for estimator precision),
	root-mean square error (for composition of bias and variance) and
	quartile ranges, including outlier behavior. In general, while cross-validation
	error estimation is much less biased than resubstitution, it displays
	excessive variance, which makes individual estimates unreliable for
	small samples. Bootstrap methods provide improved performance relative
	to variance, but at a high computational cost and often with increased
	bias (albeit, much less than with resubstitution).},

	method for identification of distinct molecular patterns and provides
	
	a powerful method for class discovery. We demonstrate the ability
	
	of NMF to recover meaningful biological information from cancer-related
	
	microarray data. NMF appears to have advantages over other methods
	
	such as hierarchical clustering or self-organizing maps. We found
	
	it less sensitive to a priori selection of genes or initial conditions
	
	and able to detect alternative or context-dependent patterns of gene
	
	expression in complex biological systems. This ability, similar to
	
	semantic polysemy in text, provides a general method for robust molecular

  volume = {25},
  pages = {i6--14},
  number = {12},
  month = {Jun},
  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Personalized medicine based on molecular aspects of diseases,
	such as gene expression profiling, has become increasingly popular.
	However, one faces multiple challenges when analyzing clinical gene
	expression data; most of the well-known theoretical issues such as
	high dimension of feature spaces versus few examples, noise and missing
	data apply. Special care is needed when designing classification
	procedures that support personalized diagnosis and choice of treatment.
	Here, we particularly focus on classification of interferon-beta
	(IFNbeta) treatment response in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients
	which has attracted substantial attention in the recent past. Half
	of the patients remain unaffected by IFNbeta treatment, which is
	still the standard. For them the treatment should be timely ceased
	to mitigate the side effects. RESULTS: We propose constrained estimation
	of mixtures of hidden Markov models as a methodology to classify
	patient response to IFNbeta treatment. The advantages of our approach
	are that it takes the temporal nature of the data into account and
	its robustness with respect to noise, missing data and mislabeled
	samples. Moreover, mixture estimation enables to explore the presence
	of response sub-groups of patients on the transcriptional level.
	We clearly outperformed all prior approaches in terms of prediction
	accuracy, raising it, for the first time, >90\%. Additionally, we
	were able to identify potentially mislabeled samples and to sub-divide
	the good responders into two sub-groups that exhibited different
	transcriptional response programs. This is supported by recent findings
	on MS pathology and therefore may raise interesting clinical follow-up
	questions. AVAILABILITY: The method is implemented in the GQL framework
	and is available at http://www.ghmm.org/gql. Datasets are available
	at http://www.cin.ufpe.br/ approximately igcf/MSConst. SUPPLEMENTARY
	INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  year = {2008},
  volume = {9},
  pages = {497},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of clustering methods for the discovery of cancer
	subtypes has drawn a great deal of attention in the scientific community.
	While bioinformaticians have proposed new clustering methods that
	take advantage of characteristics of the gene expression data, the
	medical community has a preference for using "classic" clustering
	methods. There have been no studies thus far performing a large-scale
	evaluation of different clustering methods in this context. RESULTS/CONCLUSION:
	We present the first large-scale analysis of seven different clustering
	methods and four proximity measures for the analysis of 35 cancer
	gene expression data sets. Our results reveal that the finite mixture
	of Gaussians, followed closely by k-means, exhibited the best performance
	in terms of recovering the true structure of the data sets. These
	methods also exhibited, on average, the smallest difference between
	the actual number of classes in the data sets and the best number
	of clusters as indicated by our validation criteria. Furthermore,
	hierarchical methods, which have been widely used by the medical
	community, exhibited a poorer recovery performance than that of the
	other methods evaluated. Moreover, as a stable basis for the assessment
	and comparison of different clustering methods for cancer gene expression
	data, this study provides a common group of data sets (benchmark
	data sets) to be shared among researchers and used for comparisons
	with new methods. The data sets analyzed in this study are available
	at http://algorithmics.molgen.mpg.de/Supplements/CompCancer/.},
